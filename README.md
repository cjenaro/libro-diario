# Routify PWA

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps with [Routify](https://routify.dev). 
It is based on [this](https://github.com/tretapey/svelte-pwa) starter.

To create a new project based on this template you can use the [svelte-pwa-cli](https://github.com/jenaro94/svelte-pwa):

```bash
npm install -g svelte-pwa
svelte-pwa path
```

Or you can use directly the following command:

```bash
npx degit jenaro94/routify-pwa-starter path
```

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd path
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## PWA Configuration

If you used the svelte-pwa cli this should be pretty straight forward and already set, if not:

- The `service-worker.js` and `manifest.json` files are in the `public` folder.
- You should update the icons in `/public/images/icons`
- For an offline experience edit the `/public/offline.html` file.
- This PWA is installable, the `/public/scripts/install.js` file has the install configuration. You should change the app name in the `logAppInstalled` function.
    Note: If you don't want to make the app installable you can remove the script from the `index.html` file in the `public` folder.
    
For more info, this template was made following this [tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp)
 
## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
